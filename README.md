# Assignment Processing System

## Overview

This JavaScript project processes and validates assignment data within a course, ensuring proper structure and handling of potential errors. It implements core JavaScript concepts such as control flow, loops, functions, and error handling to create a robust and reusable solution.

## Features

- **Course and Assignment Validation**: Ensures that assignment groups belong to the correct course.
- **Grade Calculation**: Computes assignment grades while preventing division by zero.
- **Data Iteration**: Loops through assignments and extracts necessary details.
- **Error Handling**: Manages errors gracefully, ensuring invalid data does not disrupt execution.
- **Data Cleansing**: Trims unnecessary spaces and checks for incorrect data types.

## Objectives

This project aims to reinforce key JavaScript concepts:

1. **Employ Basic JavaScript Syntax Accurately**: Utilize fundamental JavaScript syntax effectively.
2. **Implement Control Flow Structures**: Use conditionals and loops to manage logical operations.
3. **Use Arrays and Objects**: Organize and manage data efficiently with JavaScript data structures.
4. **Develop Functions**: Create reusable, modular code to simplify complex logic.
5. **Utilize Loops and Iteration**: Navigate through data collections to extract and manipulate information.
6. **Implement Error Handling**: Manage potential failures gracefully to ensure code robustness.
